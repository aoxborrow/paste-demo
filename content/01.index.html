@description: An example site built using Paste CMS.

<h1><span style="color: #666;">Hello, this is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; color: #444;">Paste</span>.</span></h1>

<h2>Paste is a super simple "CMS" built around static files and folders instead of a database. It aims to be fast and easy to maintain. Each HTML file represents a page in the menu, each folder represents a section, to infinite depth. Mustache is used for versatile templating including partials.</h2>
