<h1>Sorenson CMS</h1>
<h2>HTML/PHP/SQL</h2>
<p>Along with the creation of all new sites and branding, <a title="Sorenson Communications" href="/work/sorenson">Sorenson Communications</a> needed a modern CMS to manage their extensive web presence. I developed a custom platform that allows the marketing team to keep content fresh across their network of sites, including mobile versions. The system is comprised of modular components built with the <a title="kohanaframework.org" href="http://kohanaframework.org" rel="external">Kohana</a> MVC framework.</p>

<p>The CMS allows fine-grained control of content and markup with hierarchal navigation, cascading templates and custom page fields. The marketing team deploys from a single development server to multiple QA and Production environments with a simple web interface. All content and assets are version controlled using Git and MySQL. The platform is quite flexible and has been adopted for customer newsletters, internal support documentation and project management.</p>

<h1>Sorenson Communications</h1>
<h2>HTML/PHP/SQL</h2>
<p>Sorenson Communications provides Video Relay Service (VRS) to the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community. Their technology helps millions of people communicate every day. I worked alongside the marketing team and talented agency of record, <a title="Rivetal.com" href="http://www.rivetal.com" rel="external">Rivetal</a>, to build an engaging web presence.</p>

<p>The new <a title="SVRS.com" href="http://www.svrs.com" rel="external">SVRS.com</a> features many videos in American Sign Language (ASL) and an innovative visual navigation to make information more easily accessible to the core audience. ASL is the first and preferred language of many deaf individuals. The <a title="Sorenson CMS" href="/work/sorenson_cms">Sorenson CMS</a> manages the entire network of sites, including video assets and mobile content.</p>-->
