<h1>Global Leasing Resource</h1>
<h2>HTML/PHP/SQL</h2>
<p>I worked with <a title="Contact Design" href="/work/contact">Contact Design</a> and the creators of <a title="WorldLeasingNews.com" href="http://www.worldleasingnews.com" rel="external">World Leasing News</a> to launch Global Leasing Resource (GLR), a new service that aims to revolutionize the leasing industry. GLR provides a directory where leasing companies from all over the world can create a free profile detailing their services. Lenders and service providers can purchase annual subscriptions and access detailed country reports.</p>

<p>The multi-page listing form, subscription tracking and data analysis make for a fairly sophisticated admin interface. A custom CMS was built using MVC principles to keep maintenance easy.</p>
