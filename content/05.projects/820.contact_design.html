<h1>Contact Design</h1>
<h2>HTML/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>Contact is a small design firm made up of good people who do great work. I shared an office and worked closely with Contact from 2006 to 2009. (That's me in the pic!) When combining forces on web projects they handle the design while I manage the development.</p><p>After moving to a great new office in downtown Salt Lake City, Contact decided to revive their aging website with a clean new design. I built the site with a backend that enables them to keep it fresh with recent creative.</p>
