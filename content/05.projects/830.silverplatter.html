<h1>Silver Platter</h1>
<h2>HTML/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>Silver Platter is the best source to find live music in Phoenix. It started as a simple mailing list full of shows and quickly became "Your Weekly Dish of Desert Culture." I designed the original site and built a custom event system which utilizes a database of artists and venues to fill out the calendar.</p>

<p class="light">Note: The current site is no longer under my control, and while it retains some interface elements, should not be considered my work.</p>
